Dmitry obtained his combined BA+MA and PhD degrees in French and Celtic studies at the Russian State University for the Humanities in Moscow. He worked on [early Irish](https://www.academia.edu/771377/F%C3%ADr_flathemon_in_the_Russian_Primary_Chronicle_The_legend_of_the_summoning_of_the_Varangians_and_the_prefatory_matter_to_Audacht_Morainn) [literature](https://www.academia.edu/1569768/On_compound_epithets_in_early_Irish_poetry), [Old Irish](https://www.academia.edu/3643401/Absolute_and_conjunct_endings_in_Old_Irish_a_survey_of_typological_parallels_with_M._Shkapa_) [grammar](https://www.academia.edu/3590210/Aspectual_distinctions_in_Old_Irish_narratives), and [phonology of Munster Irish](https://www.academia.edu/28336839/An_update_on_the_phonology_of_Gaeilge_Chorca_Dhuibhne) before switching to phonological typology.
