Shira has a B.A. degree in Cognitive Science and Philosophy and a M.A. degree in Cognitive Science, both from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. She is interested in language acquisition and language change. Her PhD research is focused on the ways by which languages are shaped by learning and communication constraints. Using psycholinguistic experiments and corpus studies, she aims to tease apart the influence of different cognitive pressures on the linguistic input.
