      <description>I am a graduate student in the Department of Linguistics, and have earned my B.A. in Linguistics and Cognitive Science and M.A. in Linguistics both at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. My current research projects are co-supervised by Dr. Eitan Grossman and Dr. Ayelet Landau from the CogSci &amp;amp; Psychology departments, and in them I apply analysis methods from the study of rhythmic neural activity to learn about temporal structure in language use.</description>
